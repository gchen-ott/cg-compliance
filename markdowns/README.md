# FedRAMP Moderate System Security Plan

Note as of November 2016: compliance.cloud.gov is a proof of concept with [old draft content about cloud.gov](https://github.com/18F/cg-compliance#whats-in-this-repository). We haven't recently updated this site, but we're still working on our SSP separately, and we plan to update this in the future with our improved SSP.
